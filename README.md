This is a JSON Web Token challenge lab. Feel free to clone it or visit it at https://jwt-lab.herokuapp.com/

If you want to get it working on your own computer/server.

git clone https://github.com/h-a-c/jwt-lab
sudo snap install ruby --classic
cd jwt-lab
bundle install 
rails db:migrate
rails s

You might have some issues with bundle install but nothing a google search can't help with.
